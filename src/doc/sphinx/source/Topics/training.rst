NNP training procedure
======================

.. warning::

   This part of the documentation is incomplete!

Creating a new high-dimensional neural network potential from scratch is
usually a multi-step iterative procedure which includes

* data set generation/augmentation,
* selection/refinement/pruning of symmetry function parameters,
* experimenting with neural network topology/settings,
* the actual neural network training, i.e. optimizing the weight parameters.
